# Reading Assistant
Reading Assistant is a second version of an App I created back in 2017 with little knowleadge about android developemnt. Check it out [Reading Assistant v1](https://github.com/jstarczewski/BookUp)
## About Reading Assistant
This is the v2 (2018) version of BookUp (Reading Assistant). Both apps will have the similar funcionality but different architecture. <br/> During development process of <b> Reading Assistant </br> I would like to learn how to : <br/>

* develop simple Android Apps in Kotlin programming language
* follow basic Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
* implement Room persistance library with more advanced database structure
* implement Data Binding Library
* implment RecyclerView in Kotlin
* work with RxJava Kotlin (background work)
* test Android Apps both with Mockito+Expresso and JUnit
